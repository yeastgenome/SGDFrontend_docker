    Click on a gene to go to its specific page within SGD; drag any of the gene objects around within the visualization
    for easier viewing. Filter similar genes by adjusting the number of datasets in which their expression profiles are
    highly correlated with the gene of interest by clicking anywhere on the slider bar or dragging the tab to the
    desired filter number. Click “Reset” to automatically redraw the diagram.
